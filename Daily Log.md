**Today's Progress**: Working on Tic Tac Toe Project. Confirmed I can get input from both 'X' and 'O' players and correctly input this into the board. Realized that need to check the input before assigning it into the board though. I tried doing this all within one function (get input, call the checking function, then assign). I am not sure if this works though since I can't ask for input again after the check if it is not correct. My while statement in the check function used to contain the user input request so this check may need to be redesigned/formatted.

I also learned some more basic formatting of syntax in markdown text ;) 

**Thoughts**: I am getting better at knowing how the functions are calling each other. Need to work on global vs. local variables and calling/working with various functions

Day 2: Oct 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Just did some simple exercises on Codecademy tonight, need to remember that it's in Python 2 and not Python 3 like I know. Did work on string functions. Was good to remind myself that some are in the format str() and len(), while others have the .upper() or .lower() dot notation. The dot notation is used on only strings, versus str() and len() can be used on different variable types.

**Thoughts**: Codecademy is a lazy way to keep reminding me of Python syntax
