Today's Progress: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
Thoughts: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

Day 1: Oct 11, 2017

Today's Progress: Working on Tic Tac Toe Project. Confirmed I can get input from both 'X' and 'O' players and correctly input this into the board. Realized that need to check the input before assigning it into the board though. I tried doing this all within one function (get input, call the checking function, then assign). I am not sure if this works though since I can't ask for input again after the check if it is not correct. My while statement in the check function used to contain the user input request so this check may need to be redesigned/formatted.

Thoughts: I am getting better at knowing how the functions are calling each other. Need to work on global vs. local variables and calling/working with various functions
